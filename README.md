# AMFTraceKiller
Used to automatically delete annoying "AMFTrace.log" created by "livehime.exe"

# How to use
1. Put "AMFTraceKiller.exe" into the directory where "livehime.exe" exists
2. Have "AMFTraceKiller.exe" start instead of "livehime.exe"

# WARNING
AMFTraceKiller may cause file loss and CPU resource waste, but I currently feel good
